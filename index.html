					But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
					She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
					I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."

					First class, yo, this is bad
					Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
					Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
					Hmm, this might be alright.

					But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
					Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
					I don't think so
					I'll see when I get there
					I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

					Well, the plane landed and when I came out
					There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
					I ain't trying to get arrested yet
					I just got here
					I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
